# Better Lifestyles Integration Issues

## Current Status
- ✅ Backend: Fully implemented and working (Products, Cart, Auth, COA APIs)
- ❌ Frontend: Still has navigation and mobile responsiveness issues

## Issues Reported by User
1. **Products not clickable** - Cannot navigate to product detail pages
2. **Mobile layout broken** - Half of page cut off, filters not responsive
3. **404/blank pages** - Navigation not working properly

## Root Cause Analysis
The issues seem to be:
1. **React Router Configuration** - Routes might not be properly configured for client-side routing
2. **Component Integration** - Backend data might not be integrating properly with frontend components
3. **Mobile CSS Issues** - Filter sidebar causing layout problems on mobile

## Required Fixes

### 1. Fix React Router
- Ensure all routes are properly configured in App.js
- Add fallback route handling for 404s
- Test client-side routing functionality

### 2. Fix Product Navigation  
- Verify product links are generated correctly with backend data
- Test product detail page rendering with real backend data
- Fix any API integration issues

### 3. Fix Mobile Responsiveness
- Fix filter sidebar on shop page for mobile
- Ensure proper responsive design across all pages
- Test on actual mobile devices

### 4. Integration Testing
- Test complete user flow: Homepage → Product List → Product Detail → COA
- Test cart functionality with backend API
- Test authentication flow

## Implementation Plan
1. First fix the React Router configuration
2. Then fix product navigation and backend integration  
3. Finally fix mobile responsiveness issues
4. Test complete end-to-end functionality

## Expected Outcome
A fully functional THCa cannabis e-commerce website that works on both desktop and mobile with complete backend integration.
